######Before you read this
You should probably know that this is a experimental project, that means this is not going to be safe and was unofficial.

#Introduction
##What is this?
This is a community-made OpenShift Cartridge repository that utilized [GitBucket](https://github.com/takezoe/gitbucket), a very early but potential GitHub clone written in Scala. By deploying this, you could have granted yourself a instant, powerful and free Git hosting on the giant OpenShift cloud.

##How to deploy this?
There are multiple methods to achive this, however in this section I'd only tell you the simplest method to do so:

1. Create a free OpenShift Account by clickin [here](https://www.openshift.com/app/account/new)
2. After signing up, you should go to the application console, and select "Add Application...".
3. In the application creation wizard, drag your browser to the bottom, and click on "Do-It-Yourself 0.1".
4. You should only change the field "Source Code" to "https://github.com/Benderwan/openshift-gitbucket" and branch name should be "__openshift__", everything else should be customized by you.
5. After all, click on "Create Application", and you will have a free Git hosting, in only or less than 60 seconds.

#####PS. The defaulting administraive user is root, while the password is also set as "root", you should change your password as soon as    possible after successfully deployed your GitBucket repository.
